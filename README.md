# antisocial-network
my new website


Design principles:
All users are on equal footing
Creating an account is invite-only
A user can create any number of named galleries
A gallery contains any number of works. Works can be single images,
audio recordings, writings (equivalent to blog posts), or conversations
A gallery can be styled for
sequential access (e.g. a webcomic) or random access or tag-based
access or whatever.
A conversation defaults to temporary unless all participants agree to
save it as a work (which is then shared between their galleries)
oh that's right we need to support multi-author works
you can post a work with "invitation to discuss" which creates a
conversation attached to it, kind of like a comment thread but the
default is no comments
