# antisocial-network
my new website


Design principles:

All users are on equal footing

Creating an account is invite-only

A user can create any number of named galleries

A gallery contains any number of works. Works can be single images,
audio recordings, writings (equivalent to blog posts), or conversations
A gallery can be styled for sequential access (e.g. a webcomic) or random access or tag-based
access or whatever.

A conversation defaults to temporary unless all participants agree to
save it as a work (which is then shared between their galleries)

oh that's right we need to support multi-author works (either person
can edit)

you can post a work with "invitation to discuss" which creates a
conversation attached to it, kind of like a comment thread but the
default is no comments

Possible integration with real social media sites? like, option to
cross-post from here to whatever site, or pull in content from
whatever site to here?

There's a chronological page of "new stuff" from one user (or from
multiple users aggregated?) but the default presentation is
gallery-based
